# Node Replay
   

### When API testing slows you down: record and replay HTTP responses like a boss

Things that will ruin your day when tests make HTTP requests to other services:

- That other service has the uptime of Twitter's API
- Network late ............ ncy
- Being-rate limited and having to wait an hour for the next test run
- Same request returns different result each time
- Everyone else on the network is deep in BitTorrent terittory

Things **node-replay** can do to make these problems go away:

- Record API response once, replay as often as necessary
- Stub HTTP requests (TBD)
- Replay different responses to same request (great for testing error handling)
- Not suck


## How to use node-replay

Like this:

```
$ npm install replay
```

Now write some simple test case:

```
assert = require("assert")
http = require("http")
replay = require("replay")

http.get({ hostname: "www.iheartquotes.com", path: "/api/v1/random" }, function(response) {
  response.body = "";
  response.on("data", function(chunk) {
    response.body = response.body + chunk;
  })
  response.on("end", function() {

    // Now check the request we made to the I <3 Quotes API
    assert.equal(response.statusCode, 200);
    assert.equal(response.body, "Oxymoron 2. Exact estimate\n\n[codehappy] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/38021\n");
    console.log("Woot!");

  })
})
```

This, of course, will fail the first time you run it.  You'll see:

```
Error: Connection to http://www.iheartquotes.com:80/api/v1/random refused: not recording and no network access
    at Array.0 (/Users/assaf/projects/node-replay/lib/replay/proxy.coffee:87:21)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:192:40)
```

Unless you tell it otherwise, **node-replay** runs in `replay` mode.  In this
mode it will replay any previously captured HTTP response, but it will not allow
any outgoing network connection.

That's the default mode for running tests.  "Why?" you ask.  Good question.
Running in `replay` mode forces any test you run to use recorded reponses, and
so it will run (and fail or pass) the same way for anyone else, any other day of
the week, on whatever hardware they use.  Even if they're on the AT&T network.

Running in `replay` mode helps you write repeatable tests.  Repeatable tests are
a Good Thing.

So the first thing you want to do to get that test to pass, is to run
**node-replay** in `record` mode.  In this mode it will replay any recorded
response, but if no response was recorded, it will make a request to the server
and capture the response.

Let's do that:

```
$ REPLAY=record node test.js
```

That wasn't too hard, but the test is still failing.  "How?" you must be
wondering and scratching your head in total disbelief.  It's actually quite
simple.

Every request you make to 'I 3> Quotes' returns a different quote, and that test
is looking for a very specific quote.  So the test will fail, and each time fail
with a different error.

So one way we can fix this test is to change the assertion.  Look at the error
message, get the actual quote and make the assertion look for that value.

Now run the test:

```
$ node test.js
Woot!
```

Did the test pass?  Of course it did.  Run it again.  Still passing?  Why, yes.

So let's have a look at that captured response.  All the respones recorded for
'I <3 Quotes>' will be listed here:

```
$ ls fixtures/www.iheartquotes.com/
```

There should be only one file there, since we only recorded one response.  The
file name is a timestamp, but feel free to rename it to something more
rescriptive.

The name of a response file doesn't matter, it can be whatever you want.  The
name of the directory does, though, it matches the service hostname (and port
when not 80).

So that was one way to fix the failing test.  Another one is to change the
recorded response to match the assertion.  Being able to edit (and create new)
responses is quite important.  Sometimes it's the easiest way to create mock
responses for testing, e.g. if you're trying to test failure conditions that are
hard to come by.

So let's edit the response file and change the body part, so the entire response
reads like this:

```
/api/v1/random

200 HTTP/1.1
server: nginx/0.7.67
date: Fri, 02 Dec 2011 02:58:03 GMT
content-type: text/plain
connection: keep-alive
etag: "a7131ebc1e81e43ea9ecf36fa2fdf610"

x-runtime: 0.158080

age: 0

Oxymoron 2. Exact estimate

```

All responses are stored as text files using the simplest format ever, so you
can edit them in Vim, or any of the many non-Vim text editors in existence:

- First comes the request path (including query string)
- Followed by any headers sent as part of the request (like `Accept` and `Authorization`)
- Then an empty line
- Next the response status code and (optional) HTTP version number
- Followed by any headers sent as part of the response
- Then another empty line
- And the rest taken by the response body

If you need to use regular expressions to match the request URL, add `REGEXP`
between the method and path, for example:

```
GET REGEXP /\/Aregexp\d/i

HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/html
```


## Settings

We've got them.  Just enough to make you happy and not enough to take all day to
explain.

The first and most obvious is the mode you run **node-reply** in:

**bloody** -- All requests go out, none get replayed.  Use this if you want to
remember what life was before you started using **node-replay**.  Also, to test
your code against changes to 3rd party API, because these do happen.  Too often.

**cheat** -- Replays recorded responses, and allow HTTP outbound requests.  This
is mighty convenient when you're writing new tests or changing code to make new,
un-recorded HTTP requests, but you haven't quite settled on which requets to
make, so you don't want any responses recorded quite yet.

**record** -- Replays recorded responses, or captures responses for future
replay.  Use this whenever you're writing new tests or code that makes new HTTP
requests.

**replay** -- Replays recorded responses, does not allow outbound requests.
This is the default mode.  That's another way of saying, "you'll be running in
this mode most of the time".

You can set the mode by setting the environment variable `REPLAY` to one of
these values:

```
$ REPLAY=record node test.js
```

Of from your code by setting `replay.mode`:

```
var Replay = require("replay");
Replay.mode = "record"
```

Of course, **node-replay** needs to store all those captured responses somewhere,
and by default it will put them in the directory `fixtures`.  Bet you have an
idea for a better directory name.  Easy to change.

Like this:

```
Replay.fixtures = __dirname + "/fixtures/replay"
```

You can tell **node-replay** what hosts to treat as "localhost".  Requests to
these hosts will be routed to 127.0.0.1, without capturing or replay.  This is
particularly useful if you're making request to a test server and want to use
the same URL as production.

For example:

```
Replay.localhost "www.example.com"
```

There may be hosts you don't care to record/replay: it doesn't matter if
requests to these hosts succeed or not, and you don't care to manage their
recorded file.  You can just add those to the ignore list:

```
Replay.ignore "www.google-analytics.com", "airbrake.io"
```

Likewise, you can tell **node-reply** to allow network access to specific hosts:

```
Replay.allow "logger.example.com"
```

Requests to allowed and ignored hosts will still replay any previously recorded
responses, but if there is no recorded response, they will either fail (ignored)
or pass through to the actual server (allowed).

If you're running into trouble, try turning debugging mode on.  It helps.
Sometimes.

```
$ DEBUG=true node test.js
Requesting http://www.iheartquotes.com:80/api/v1/random
Woot!
```


## Geeking

To make all that magic possible, **node-replay** replaces
`require('http').request` with its own method.  That method returns a
`ProxyRequest` object that captures the request URL, headers and body.

When it's time to fire the request, it gets sent through a chain of proxies.
The first proxy to have a response, returns it (via callback, this is Node.js
after all).  That terminates the chain.  A proxy that doesn't have a response
still has to call the callback, but with no arguments.  The request will then
pass to the next proxy down the chain.

The proxy chain looks something like this:

- Logger dumps the request URL when running with `DEBUG=true`
- The pass-through proxy will pass the request directly to the server in `bloody` mode, or when talking to `localhost`
- The recorder proxy will either replay a captured request (if it has one), talk to the server and capture the response
  (in `record` mode), or pass to the next proxy
- The pass-through proxy (2nd one) will pass the request to the server in `cheat` mode, return nothing in all other
  modes

Loading pre-recorded responses to memory, from where they can be replayed, and
storing new ones on disk, is handled by ... cue big band ... the `Catalog`.
