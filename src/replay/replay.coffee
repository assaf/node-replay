# Instance properties:
#
# catalog   - The catalog is responsible for loading pre-recorded responses
#             into memory, from where they can be replayed, and storing captured responses.
#
# chain     - The proxy chain.  Essentially an array of proxies through which
#             each request goes, from first to last.  You generally don't need
#             to use this unless you decide to reconstruct your own chain.
#
#             When adding new proxies, you probably want those executing ahead
#             of any existing proxies (certainly the pass-through proxy), so
#             you'll want to prepend them.  The `use` method will prepend a
#             proxy to the chain.
#
# debug     - Set this to true to dump more information to the console, or run
#             with DEBUG=true
#
# headers   - Only these headers are matched when recording/replaying.  A list
#             of regular expressions.
#
# fixtures  - Main directory for replay fixtures.
#
# logger    - Logger to use (defaults to console)
#
# mode      - The mode we're running in, one of:
#   bloody  - Allow outbound HTTP requests, don't replay anything.  Use this to
#             test your code against changes to 3rd party API.
#   cheat   - Allow outbound HTTP requests, replay captured responses.  This
#             mode is particularly useful when new code makes new requests, but
#             unstable yet and you don't want these requests saved.
#   record  - Allow outbound HTTP requests, capture responses for future
#             replay.  This mode allows you to capture and record new requests,
#             e.g. when adding tests or making code changes.
#   replay  - Do not allow outbound HTTP requests, replay captured responses.
#             This is the default mode and the one most useful for running tests
#
# silent    - If true do not emit errors to logger
